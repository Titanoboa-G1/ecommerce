## Conflict Plan

> What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
>> Each team member will have responsibility to resolve his/her conflict by himself, if it did not work we all can meet and decide which the best approach to go with.

> What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
>> When we set up the plan, each team member will have tasks to do, to make sure that every one have equal chance to participate in the project.

> How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
>> Basically the team members will provide help for each others as much as possible. Also, we have the TA's and the instructor to ask them questions if we want something when the team is not available.

> How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
>> By informing the one who is not contributing directly that he/she must do his/her work or it will affect our project and the final result.

> How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
>> When we can't agree on a solution the team lead will escalate the conflict.
